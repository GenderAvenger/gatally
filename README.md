Gender Avenger Tally
===========

This application is a tool that makes it easy to create and share visual commentary
on observed gender diversity in any setting.  Users submit information through a form
which is then used to generate a visualization.  That visualization can then be shared
through email or social media.


## Prerequisites
This code base is written in Node.JS and is designed to be deployable via Heroku.

It requires imagemagick in order to generate visualizations.

## Setting up (dev)

1. Make sure baseline project prerequisites are installed (Node.js, Git)

2. Install Imagemagick (homebrew, apt, or from binaries)

3. Clone the repository

4. Create and populate the credentials file: `cp creds.yaml.template creds.yaml`


## Deploying (prod)

(Insert Heroku deployment instructions here)
