<p>Gender Avengers will be on the lookout for your images. We can also connect you with our Gender Avenger Pros, who will be standing by, ready to support you. Raising your voice can have real, concrete impact.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ul><li>Did you share the visualization yet?</li>
<li>Approach one of the conference organizers and discuss your concerns</li>
<li>Let some other folks know what you are doing, so they can join and support you in these conversations</li></ul>

<p>What about those times when you look up and say, “Wow, look at all the women!” Share the visualization and reward the organizers!</p>
